   -> React with TS

1. Setting up/ running the project:
   -> Clone the repo.
   -> cd /bingo-quiz
   -> Make sure you have node and npm.
   -> npm install
   -> npm start OR npm run build

Q. How does it work?
-> It's just a bingo game where there is a question locked behind a square and right answer would make that square yours.

Features:
-> There is a context menu (right-click) to choose colors (4 hardcoded a.t.m).
-> There is a simple timer to add extra
-> The timer automatically starts once a square (and by consequence a question) is selected.
-> The timer stops once the button to get answer is clicked.
